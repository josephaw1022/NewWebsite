# React Resume

- Portfolio site that was made with Create React App and Typescript 
- 
- Heroku and Django backend (no longer supported)
  - Used django at the time because that is what I knew the best for backend stuff but I know Node and Nest Js now way better than I knew Django, so if I were to redo it, I would rewrite it in a node application via v3 of the serverless framework and end up not having to pay heroku $7 a month and instead pay a dollar or two at the most using the serverless rds client or dynamodb .
